OpenGl Examples
===========
eclipse/ has the examples that eclipse can load (no longer updated).  Otherwise, in andriod studio.


OpenGL 1.1 examples

  OpenGLDemo is a very basic framework that draws a 2d square

  OpenGL  show a triagle, cube, and lighting

  BouncyCube, solarSystem, and Vortex  show moving and touch event with the onpengl.
  
OpenGL 2.0 examples

  HelloOpenGLES20 is google's basic framework example.  2D square and triangle with touch events to spin the triangle

  Opengl2ex1  uses a renderer (lessonOne from http://www.learnopengles.com/android-lesson-one-getting-started/) and mainactivity to setup everything
    NOTE: this example may fail in the emulators, but works on a physical device.

  Opengl2ex2  extends a GLsurfaceView to setup everything.  Again, use the Lessonone renderer.

OpenGL 3.0 examples are intended to get you started in OpenGL 3.0, but don't provide any depth of coverage.

  HelloOpenGLES30 is google's basic framework example from 20, updated to opengl3.0.  2D square and triangle with touch events to spin the triangle

  Opengl3ex1 is based on Opengl2ex1, with references changed to GLES30.  Note this may fail in emulators.
  
  Opengl3ex2 is based on Opengl2ex2, again with references changed. Note this may fail in emulators.

  Opengl3ex3 is from the OpenGL ES 3.0 Programing Guide, which can be found here: http://opengles-book.com/samplecode.html

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
