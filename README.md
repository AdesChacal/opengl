OpenGL 1.1 examples

  OpenGLDemo is a very basic framework that draws a 2d square

  OpenGL  show a triagle, cube, and lighting

  BouncyCube, solarSystem, and Vortex  show moving and touch event with the onpengl.
  
OpenGL 2.0 examples

  HelloOpenGLES20 is google's basic framework example.  2D square and triangle with touch events to spin the triangle

  Opengl2ex1  uses a renderer (lessonOne from http://www.learnopengles.com/android-lesson-one-getting-started/) and mainactivity to setup everything
    NOTE: this example may fail in the emulators, but works on a physical device.

  Opengl2ex1  extends a GLsurfaceView to setup everything.  Again, use the Lessonone renderer.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
